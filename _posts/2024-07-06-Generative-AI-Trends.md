Since the release of ChatGPT in late 2022, large language models have become a significant area for innovation. These models have transitioned to being more enterprise-friendly, allowing secure deployment behind enterprise firewalls and easy fine-tuning with enterprise data. This shift has made them indispensable tools for various clients, enabling large-scale production deployments.

#### Small Language Models
The market is also seeing a trend toward smaller language models that focus on narrow domains. These models, such as those trained on specific data sets like IBM's Ansible scripts, can outperform larger models like GPT-4 in their specialized areas. The reduced total cost of ownership and efficient performance make them attractive for specific enterprise applications.

#### Large Multimodal Models
Large multimodal models are pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities. These models can process and integrate information from text, images, video, and audio, providing a comprehensive understanding of complex scenes. Despite being niche and expensive, their capabilities are expected to improve significantly throughout 2024.

#### Open Source LLM Models
Open-source models, though varying in licensing openness, offer significant advantages in terms of transparency and customization. Models like Meta's and Google's provide the code or weights used for training, allowing enterprises to fine-tune them with their own data. This trend is fostering a collaborative environment that enhances model capabilities.

#### LLM Agents and Large Action Models
LLM agents are transforming how tasks are executed autonomously, breaking down complex requests into actionable steps and integrating with backend systems. Large action models are evolving from traditional RPA bots by learning how humans interact with software and transferring that knowledge to new interfaces. These advancements are poised to change the industry landscape in 2024.


### Towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
The convergence of these trends points towards a future where AI transcends its current limitations and approaches artificial general intelligence (AGI). AGI is the hypothetical ability of an AI system to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can.  While we're not there yet, the rapid progress in GenAI suggests that AGI may be closer than we think.

Imagine an AI that can not only understand complex scientific literature but also design experiments, interpret results, and even propose new theories. Or an AI that can collaborate with humans on creative projects, generating ideas, refining concepts, and producing finished works of art, music, or literature.
